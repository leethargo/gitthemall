* git them all!
Synchronize several git repositories automatically.

Per repository, allow any of the these actions:
 - =fetch= from =origin= (always done implicitely)
 - =pull --rebase= from =origin=
 - =commit= all changes from dirty tree, with timestamp in message
 - =push= to =origin=

The program fetches from =origin= and analyzes the current state. If
allowed, it brings repos up-to-date. Otherwise, the user is informed
about differences.

* Configuration
Configuration with simple text file:
 - one line per repo
 - first item is path to repo
 - rest of line are comma-separated values from
   - =pull=
   - =commit=
   - =push=

* Dependencies
=gitthemall= is developed in Python 2 and uses the =sh= package.
